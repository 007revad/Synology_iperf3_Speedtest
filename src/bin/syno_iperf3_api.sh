# CPUTemp package - root-run wrapper, called via sudo from api.cgi.
#
# syno_cpu_temp.sh already reads Log/Log_Directory from
# syno_cpu_temp.conf next to it (via synogetkeyvalue), and writes the
# log header itself the first time it runs. This wrapper adds:
#   - a Log_Days key in the same conf file (new, package-specific)
#   - pruning of log entries older than Log_Days after each run
#   - settings read/write for the Settings window
#
# Usage:
#   cpu_temp_api.sh run
#   cpu_temp_api.sh getlog
#   cpu_temp_api.sh getsettings
#   cpu_temp_api.sh setsettings <log_enabled yes|no> <log_days N>

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Self-heal file ownership.
#
# bin/ and bin/modules/ are locked to 555 by postinst, which blocks
# create/delete/rename of files inside them - but postinst runs as
# CPUTemp, not root (confirmed 2026-08-15), so it can never chown
# anything. Every file under bin/ therefore starts out still owned by
# CPUTemp. An owner can always chmod u+w their own file regardless
# of the containing directory's permissions, then overwrite its
# content in place - confirmed exploitable against conf_lib.sh on
# DS218 2026-08-15 despite bin/ being 555.
#
# Since this script always runs as root (invoked only via
# synocputemp-helper's setuid), it closes that gap on every single
# invocation: chown root:root + re-lock any file that's still
# CPUTemp-owned. Cheap enough to run unconditionally rather than
# caching a "did we already do this" flag - a handful of stat calls.
#
# Targets are found by globbing bin/ directly. Since both directories 
# are 555 (no new files can be created), globbing what's actually on 
# disk covers every possible overwrite target without trusting content
# that could be the attack itself.
#
# LIMITATION: This cannot protect this script (cpu_temp_api.sh)
# itself if it's been replaced before this code runs, the replacement
# executes instead and this check never fires - self-heal logic in the
# original file doesn't help once the original file is gone. This is
# a narrow, accepted gap: the window between postinst completing and
# the first invocation of this script (which happens automatically on
# first page load via getstate). Everything this function iterates
# over is fully self-healing from that point forward; this file itself
# is the one exception.
